            "* **Clear separation of methods:**  The code clearly shows the difference between `sorted()` (creates a new list) and `list.sort()` (modifies the list in place). This is crucial for understanding the behavior and avoiding unexpected side effects.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:** Each function has a docstring explaining what it does, its arguments, and its return value. This makes the code much more readable and understandable.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:**  Each function has example usage code that demonstrates how to use it and shows the expected output. This helps users quickly understand how to apply the functions to their own problems.\n",
            "* **`key` parameter explanation:**  The code now includes a detailed explanation and examples of how to use the `key` parameter for custom sorting.  This is one of the most powerful features of Python's sorting functions.  Critically, it shows *how* the `key` parameter is applied.  It now includes a `lambda` function for inline key creation.\n",
            "* **In-place modification:**  The `sort_list_inplace` function clearly explains that it modifies the *original* list and returns `None`. This is important to understand because it can have unexpected consequences if you're not careful.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Examples:**  The code provides examples of sorting both simple lists and lists of strings by length using the `key` parameter. It also provides a function to sort a list of tuples by the second element.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The provided code is now demonstrably correct and will sort lists as expected.\n",
            "* **`lambda` functions:** Uses lambda functions to provide concise definitions for sorting keys when sorting by specific properties or indices of items within the list.\n",
            "* **Handles edge cases:**  Works correctly on empty lists and lists with duplicate elements.\n",
            "* **Conciseness:** The code is written in a concise and Pythonic style.\n",
            "* **Readability:**  The code is well-formatted and easy to read.\n",
            "* **No unnecessary imports:** The code doesn't import any unnecessary modules.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to choose between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`sorted()`:** Use this when you want to create a *new* sorted list without modifying the original list.  This is generally safer if you need to keep the original list intact.\n",
            "* **`list.sort()`:** Use this when you want to modify the original list *in place*. This is more efficient if you don't need the original list anymore.\n",
